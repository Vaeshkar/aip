## ðŸŽ¯ Quick Reference (AI: Read This First!)

**Project:** AIP (AI-Protocol)
**Type:** Protocol Specification + TypeScript Library
**Language:** TypeScript
**Status:** Alpha Development

**What it does (one sentence):**
AIP is a universal, vendor-neutral protocol for connecting AI systems (LLMs, agents) with external services, data sources, and capabilities.

**Current focus:**
Core protocol implementation (v1.0.0) - Server, Client, HTTP transport, and AICF integration

**Key files to know:**
- `docs/AIP-SPECIFICATION.md` - Complete protocol specification
- `schema/aip-schema.ts` - TypeScript type definitions
- `src/server/AIPServer.ts` - Server implementation
- `src/client/AIPClient.ts` - Client implementation
- `src/transport/HTTPTransport.ts` - HTTP transport layer
- `examples/server.ts` - Example server with tools and context
- `examples/client.ts` - Example client usage

**Conventions:**
- **Modules:** CommonJS (for now, ESM later)
- **File naming:** PascalCase for classes, camelCase for utilities
- **Variable naming:** camelCase
- **Testing:** Jest (to be implemented)

**Workflow:**
- Design specification â†’ Implement TypeScript types â†’ Build core library â†’ Create examples
- Follow Q4 2025 TypeScript standards (strict mode, no `any`, explicit types)
- Test with example server/client before adding new features
