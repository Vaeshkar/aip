## 🔄 HOW TO USE THIS FILE

### For AI Assistants:

1. **At START of session:**

   - Read the most recent entries (top of file)
   - Understand what was accomplished in previous chats
   - Check "Next Steps" to see what needs to be done

2. **At END of session:**
   - Add a new entry at the TOP of the file (most recent first)
   - Be specific about what you accomplished
   - List any decisions made and why
   - Note what should be done next

### For Developers:

- Update this file after important AI chat sessions
- Keep entries concise but informative
- Use this to onboard new team members
- Review periodically to track project evolution

## 📋 CHAT HISTORY (Most Recent First)

## Chat #1 - [Date: 2025-10-20] - AIP Protocol Development

### What We Did

- **Researched MCP (Model Context Protocol)** from Anthropic to understand existing AI protocol standards
- **Designed AIP (AI-Protocol)** - A universal, vendor-neutral protocol for AI services
- **Created comprehensive specification** (docs/AIP-SPECIFICATION.md) covering:
  - Protocol architecture and message format (JSON-RPC 2.0)
  - Handshake and capability negotiation
  - Tool invocation, context sharing, and resource management
  - Multiple transport layers (HTTP, WebSocket, stdio)
  - Security and authentication mechanisms
- **Implemented TypeScript schema** (schema/aip-schema.ts) with complete type definitions
- **Built core library** with:
  - AIPServer class for hosting services
  - AIPClient class for connecting to services
  - HTTPTransport for HTTP-based communication
  - Error handling and JSON-RPC utilities
- **Created working examples** demonstrating server and client usage
- **Integrated AICF** (AI Context Format) as native context format

### Key Decisions

- **JSON-RPC 2.0 as base protocol**: Proven standard, wide compatibility, easy to implement
- **Vendor-neutral design**: Not tied to any specific LLM provider (unlike MCP → Anthropic)
- **AICF-native support**: Seamless integration with existing AICF ecosystem
- **Multiple transports**: HTTP, WebSocket, stdio for flexibility
- **TypeScript-first**: Strong typing for better DX and fewer runtime errors

### Problems Solved

- **Vendor lock-in**: Created open alternative to vendor-specific protocols
- **Interoperability**: Enables any LLM to connect to any AIP service
- **Context sharing**: Native AICF support for efficient AI-to-AI communication

### Next Steps

- [ ] Implement WebSocket transport
- [ ] Implement stdio transport
- [ ] Add streaming support for long-running operations
- [ ] Create client SDKs for Python, Go, Rust
- [ ] Build example services (filesystem, database, API)
- [ ] Create CLI tool for testing and debugging
- [ ] Write comprehensive documentation
- [ ] Set up CI/CD pipeline
- [ ] Publish to npm

## Chat #1 - [Date: YYYY-MM-DD] - [Brief Topic]

### What We Did

- [Be specific: "Implemented user authentication with JWT tokens"]
- [Not vague: "Worked on auth"]
- [List all significant changes, features, or refactors]

### Key Decisions

- **[Decision]:** [Why we chose this approach over alternatives]
- **Example:** "Used JWT instead of sessions because we need stateless API"

### Problems Solved

- **[Problem]:** [Solution we implemented]
- **Example:** "CORS errors on login - Fixed by adding credentials: 'include' to fetch"

### Next Steps

- [What should be done in the next session]
- [Unfinished work or follow-ups]
- [Known issues that need attention]

## 💡 Tips for AI-Optimized Entries

- **Use YAML format for structured data** - Easier to parse than prose
- **Be specific:** "Added bcrypt password hashing to login API" not "worked on login"
- **Include WHY:** Rationale is more important than WHAT for future decisions
- **Note alternatives:** What was considered and rejected helps avoid repeating mistakes
- **Use semantic types:** FEAT, FIX, REFACTOR, DOCS, RELEASE, WORK
- **Truncate long content:** Max 120 chars per line for token efficiency

**Last Updated:** [Date]

## 🚨 REMINDER FOR AI ASSISTANTS

**Before ending your session, you MUST:**

1. Run `npx aic chat-finish` to automatically update all .ai/ files
2. OR manually add a YAML entry at the TOP of the "CHAT HISTORY" section
3. Update the "Last Updated" date at the bottom
4. Tell the user: "I've updated the conversation log for the next session"

**If you don't do this, the next AI session will NOT know what you accomplished!**
